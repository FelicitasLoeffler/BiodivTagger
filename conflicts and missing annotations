Following we have included MISSING annotations. These are those annotation which are present in old standard but pipeline has not 
labelled it. It means they are absent in ontologies for related categories.

Following are the CONFLICT cases. They are those annotation which has different category in Gold Standard and Pipeline. They need to be discussed with more expert for the final conclusion:
      Soil (in ENVO Material, in gold standard Environment)
      mediterranen, subtropical (in ENVO Material, in gold standard Quality as it is quality of an environment) 
      slope (in ENVO Environment, in gold standard Quality)
      branch (in ENVO Environment, in gold standard it is not labelled as it is an anatomical part of the tree)
      wood (in ENVO Environment, in gold standard Material)
      growth (in GO Process, in gold standard Quality)
      Weather (in ENVO Quality, in gold standard Environment)
      Boreal (in ENVO Quality, in gold standard Environment)
      Biomass (in ENVO Material, in gold standard both Material and Quality)

# Ontological Issues

The follwing list provides missing annotations. These annotations are present in the gold standard but no concept in one of the selected ontologies could be found.

* Environment : 
	* Nature Reserve 
	* tropical forest
	* drop
	* belowground
	* aboveground
	* lowland
	* coastal
	* dryland
	* rainforest
      
* Material: 
	* resin
	* deadwood

* Process: 
	* nutrient retention
	* nutrient cycling
	* decomposition
	* rhizodeposition
	* respiration
	* habitat fragmentation or fragmentation
	* breeding
	* extinction
	* glaciation
	* irrigation
	* bioirrigation
	* bioturbation
	* rainfall
	* adaptive radiation
	* oxygen uptake (ENVO only provides uptake)
	* nitrogen uptake (ENVO only provides uptake)
	* carbon uptake (ENVO only provides uptake)
	  
* Quality: 
	* warm
	* abundance
	* soil moisture or moisture
	* species richness
	* alcanity
	* fugacity
	* salinity
	* heat combustion or combustion

Following are the conflict cases. A different entity type was assigned in the gold standard as it occurs in ontologies:
* soil (in ENVO Material, in gold standard Environment)
* branch (in ENVO Environment, in gold standard it is not labelled as it is an anatomical part of the tree)
* wood (in ENVO Environment, in gold standard Material)
* weather (in ENVO Quality, in gold standard both Environment and Process)
* biomass (in ENVO Material, in gold standard both Material and Quality)
* climate (in ENVO environmental disposition, in gold standard PROCESS)

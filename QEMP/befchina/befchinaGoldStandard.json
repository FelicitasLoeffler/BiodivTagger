Main Experiment plots have a size of 1 mu, which is about 25x25m^2 in horizontal projection. Pilot Study Plots have a size of 1x1 m^2.  \nResearch plots on the main experiment have a \"p\" in front of their IDs and then a 6 digit code: Plots in the main sites A (29°07'28.2\"N 117°54'27.5\"E) and B (29°05'06.8\"N 117°55'44.4\"E) are named according to their position in the original spreadsheet, in which they were designed.  They consist of 6 digits: _1st digit_: Site (1:A, 2:B), _digit 2and3_: southwards row: as in spreadsheets the rows are named from the top to the bottom; _digit 4 and 5_: westward column: as in the original spreadsheet, but the letters are converted to numbers (A=01, B=02); _6th digit_: indicator, if the plot has been shifted a quarter mu.  Example: \"p205260\": \"p\" means that this is a plot that is specified.  \"2\" means, that we are at site B.  Now the coordinates of the south - west corner: \"0526\".  Since \"e\" is the fifth letter of the alphabet, this is Plot E26.   The last digit \"0\" means that this plot was not moved by a quarter of a Mu, as some sites in Site A. The 6th digit can also indicate the subplot within the plot. \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\" indicate the northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest quarter plot respectively.\nMorover, Plots from the main experiment may be labelled in the more ambiguous  form of e.g. A32.

The Gutianshan NNR has an area of approximately 81 km2 and was initially established as a National Forest Reserve in 1975 and became a National Nature Reserve in 2001. The NNR comprises a large portion of broad-leaved forests of advanced successional stages (Hu &amp; Yu 2008), which have not been managed since the beginning of the 1990ies, as well as young successional stages and conifer plantations, mainly of Cunninghamia lanceolata and Pinus massoniana. --- The vegetation is composed of different types of subtropical evergreen and mixed broad-leaved forests (Yu et al. 2001). Most of the stands are secondary forests, evidenced by maximum tree ages of 180 years, by agricultural terraces in almost all plots and by the presence of charcoal in almost all soil profiles. Around the Gutianshan NRR extensive deforestation has occurred during the Great Leap Forward in the 1950s, as in most parts of Southeast China. However, due to prevailing steep slopes, the Gutianshan area was only marginally usable for agricultural activities, and thus an exceptionally intact forest cover has been preserved. --- The climate at Gutianshan NNR is warm and temperate with a short dry season in November and December and with warm summers (Fig. 2). The climatic conditions are characteristic for the subtropics with an annual average temperature of 15.1°C, January minimum temperatures of -6.8°C, July maximum temperatures of 38.1°C and an accumulated temperature sum (≥ 5°C) of 5221.5 degree days.\n\n117.89978\n118.148346\n29.285201\n29.101777\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2008-01-30\n\n\n\n\n2009-11-29\n\n\n\n\n\nTree species in the Comparative study plots.\n\n\nTree species in the Comparative study plots.\n\n\n\n\n\nbschmid\n\n\nmbaruffol\n\n\n\n\nCSPs: Tree size in the CSPs in 2008 and 2009\nTree size in diameter at breastheight (dbh) and/or basal area, as well as height of trees found in the CSPs.

There are three main sites for research plots in the BEF Experiment: Comparative Study Plots (CSP) in the  Gutianshan Nature Reserve (29º8'18\" – 29º17'29\" N, 118º2'14\" – 118º11'12\" E, Zhejiang Province Southeast China), having a size of 30x30m^2, measured on the ground. Main Experiment plots have a size of 1 mu, which is about 25x25m^2 in horizontal projection. Pilot Study Plots have a size of 1x1 m^2.  \nResearch plots on the main experiment have a \"p\" in front of their IDs and then a 6 digit code: Plots in the main sites A (29°07'28.2\"N 117°54'27.5\"E) and B (29°05'06.8\"N 117°55'44.4\"E) are named according to their position in the original spreadsheet, in which they were designed.  They consist of 6 digits: _1st digit_: Site (1:A, 2:B), _digit 2and3_: southwards row: as in spreadsheets the rows are named from the top to the bottom; _digit 4 and 5_: westward column: as in the original spreadsheet, but the letters are converted to numbers (A=01, B=02); _6th digit_: indicator, if the plot has been shifted a quarter mu.  Example: \"p205260\": \"p\" means that this is a plot that is specified.  \"2\" means, that we are at site B.  Now the coordinates of the south - west corner: \"0526\".  Since \"e\" is the fifth letter of the alphabet, this is Plot E26.   The last digit \"0\" means that this plot was not moved by a quarter of a Mu, as some sites in Site A. The 6th digit can also indicate the subplot within the plot. \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\" indicate the northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest quarter plot respectively.\nMorover, Plots from the main experiment may be labelled in the more ambiguous  form of e.g. A32.

The Gutianshan NNR has an area of approximately 81 km2 and was initially established as a National Forest Reserve in 1975 and became a National Nature Reserve in 2001. The NNR comprises a large portion of broad-leaved forests of advanced successional stages (Hu &amp; Yu 2008), which have not been managed since the beginning of the 1990ies, as well as young successional stages and conifer plantations, mainly of Cunninghamia lanceolata and Pinus massoniana. --- The vegetation is composed of different types of subtropical evergreen and mixed broad-leaved forests (Yu et al. 2001). Most of the stands are secondary forests, evidenced by maximum tree ages of 180 years, by agricultural terraces in almost all plots and by the presence of charcoal in almost all soil profiles. Around the Gutianshan NRR extensive deforestation has occurred during the Great Leap Forward in the 1950s, as in most parts of Southeast China. However, due to prevailing steep slopes, the Gutianshan area was only marginally usable for agricultural activities, and thus an exceptionally intact forest cover has been preserved. --- The climate at Gutianshan NNR is warm and temperate with a short dry season in November and December and with warm summers (Fig. 2). The climatic conditions are characteristic for the subtropics with an annual average temperature of 15.1°C, January minimum temperatures of -6.8°C, July maximum temperatures of 38.1°C and an accumulated temperature sum (≥ 5°C) of 5221.5 degree days.\n\n117.89978\n118.148346\n29.285201\n29.101777\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2008-05-14\n\n\n\n\n2009-12-29\n\n\n\n\n\nThe forest is representative for Chinese mixed broad-leaved forests (Wu 1980, Hu &amp; Yu 2008, Legendre et al. 2009), with evergreen species dominating the forest in number of individuals (Yu et al. 2001) but with approximately similar proportions of deciduous species in terms of species number (Lou and Jin 2000).

This file includes the names of all tree and shrub species found in the each of the CSPs during the field work 2008 / 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\n2008-05-14 00:00:00 UTC - 2009-12-29 00:00:00 UTC\nMost of the data were collected in 2008, while some additional data were also collected in 2009.\nThe Gutianshan National Nature Reserve (NNR) is located in the western part of Zhejiang Province (29º8'18\" – 29º17'29\" N, 118º2'14\" – 118º11'12\" E, Fig. 1).  The Gutianshan NNR has an area of approximately 81 km2 and was initially established as a National Forest Reserve in 1975 and became a National Nature Reserve in 2001. The NNR comprises a large portion of broad-leaved forests of advanced successional stages (Hu &amp; Yu 2008), which have not been managed since the beginning of the 1990ies, as well as young successional stages and conifer plantations, mainly of Cunninghamia lanceolata and Pinus massoniana. --- The vegetation is composed of different types of subtropical evergreen and mixed broad-leaved forests (Yu et al. 2001). Most of the stands are secondary forests, evidenced by maximum tree ages of 180 years, by agricultural terraces in almost all plots and by the presence of charcoal in almost all soil profiles. Around the Gutianshan NRR extensive deforestation has occurred during the Great Leap Forward in the 1950s, as in most parts of Southeast China. However, due to prevailing steep slopes, the Gutianshan area was only marginally usable for agricultural activities, and thus an exceptionally intact forest cover has been preserved. --- The climate at Gutianshan NNR is warm and temperate with a short dry season in November and December and with warm summers (Fig. 2). The climatic conditions are characteristic for the subtropics with an annual average temperature of 15.1°C, January minimum temperatures of -6.8°C, July maximum temperatures of 38.1°C and an accumulated temperature sum (≥ 5°C) of 5221.5 degree days.\nThe forest is representative for Chinese mixed broad-leaved forests (Wu 1980, Hu &amp; Yu 2008, Legendre et al. 2009), with evergreen species dominating the forest in number of individuals (Yu et al. 2001) but with approximately similar proportions of deciduous species in terms of species number (Lou and Jin 2000). A total of 1426 seed plant species of 648 genera and of 149 families has been recorded as occurring naturally in the NNR. About 258 of the species are woody (Lou and Jin 2000).\n\n\n\nTrees surpassing 3cm in dbh were counted in each plot, plots followed a stratified sampling crossing diversity and successional age: The utilization of the forest until the 1990ies allowed us to employ a stratified sampling for establishing observational plots (in the following called Comparative Study Plots, CSPs) according to successional stages. Although most of the forest are belongs to intermediate or late successional stages, young stands are located in the peripheral buffer zone of the Gutianshan NNR, where logging has been performed until the present. Plots were assigned to five strata according to the average age of tree layer individuals (1: &lt; 20 yrs, 2: &lt; 40 yrs, 3: &lt; 60 yrs, 4: &lt; 80 yrs, 5: &gt; 80 yrs). CSP locations within strata were selected randomly; however, due to inaccessibility and excessive slopes (&gt; 50°) of many locations, parts to the NNR had to be excluded from sampling, thus, resulting in an uneven distribution of some of the plots (Fig. 1). In total, 27 CSPs were established between May and July 2008. Species recording was performed between May and October 2008 with several visits per plot. Each CSP has a size of 30 m by 30 m, which approximates to the plot size (1 mu plot) in the BEF-Experiment at Xingangshan (Jiangxi, Fig. 1). The corners of every CSP were permanently marked with magnets and subareas of each CSP were set apart for measuring various ecosystem functioning variables, among them basic soil properties. Soil moisture was assessed on soil samples taken from five different layers of the mineral soil in 10 cm-intervals on three dates (summer and autumn 2008, spring 2009). We used mean values by averaging the soil water contents over all layers and all dates. Topsoil samples (0-5 cm) were taken in summer 2009 from four locations in each plot, pooled in a bulk sample per CSP, air-dried and then used to determine pH, both measured in H2O and 1 M KCl. A complete inventory of woody species and bamboo (Pleioblastus amarus) (&gt; 1 m height) was carried out on the whole plot. All herbaceous species and tree recruits (i.e. seedlings and saplings â¤ 1 m height) were recorded in a central subplot of 10 m x 10 m. All individuals were identified to the species level, making use of herbarium samples and comparisons with correctly identified individuals, and counted per species. The proportion of unidentifiable individuals in a CSP ranged between 0 % and 2.3 %. These individuals were not included in the subsequent data analysis.\nData are given in the long format, so that there is one column for abundance only.

Samples were bulked from the 9 corings to one sample per depth increment (0-5, 5-10, 10-20 cm.), so that 3 samples exist per CSP. samples were air-dried, sieved &lt; 2mm, using approx. 500mg per sample for analysis with hedley fractionation method (a sequential extraction method for organic and inorganic P fractions), photometric measurement of Phosphorus with molybdenum blue method according to Murphy &amp; Riley (1962).\nPhosphorus fractions in soils were analyzed by the sequential extraction method according to Hedley (Hedley et al. 1982a). The whole fractionation process used for this data is described in detail by Tiessen and Moir (2008). The general usefulness of this method to determine P in fractions of distinctly different solubility is widely discussed (Condron and Newman 2011, Cross and Schlesinger 1995, Yang and Post 2011). The individual fractions can be described as readily soluble and exchangeable Pi (Pi Resin), desorbable Pi (pi_nahco3) and readily mineralizable Po (po_nahco3), Fe/Al associated Pi (pi_naoh, pi_naoh_s) and Fe/Al associated Po (po_naoh, po_naoh_s), Ca associated Pi (pi_1mhcl, pi_hcl_conc), Ca associated Po (po_hcl_conc), and residual P (tp_residual). For the purpose of subsequent statistical analyses, the Hedley fractions can be grouped by their solubility in labile (pi_resin, pi_nahco3 and po_nahco3), moderate labile (pi_naoh, pi_naoh_s, po_naoh, po_naoh_s, pi_1mhcl) and stable P pools (pi_hcl_conc, po_hcl_conc, tp_residual) as commonly found in literature.

They consist of 6 digits: _1st digit_: Site (1:A, 2:B), _digit 2and3_: southwards row: as in spreadsheets the rows are named from the top to the bottom; _digit 4 and 5_: westward column: as in the original spreadsheet, but the letters are converted to numbers (A=01, B=02); _6th digit_: indicator, if the plot has been shifted a quarter mu.  Example: \"p205260\": \"p\" means that this is a plot that is specified.  \"2\" means, that we are at site B.  Now the coordinates of the south - west corner: \"0526\".  Since \"e\" is the fifth letter of the alphabet, this is Plot E26.   The last digit \"0\" means that this plot was not moved by a quarter of a Mu, as some sites in Site A. The 6th digit can also indicate the subplot within the plot. \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\" indicate the northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest quarter plot respectively.\nMorover, Plots from the main experiment may be labelled in the more ambiguous  form of e.g. A32. This indicates a plat either on Site A (29°07'28.2\"N 117°54'27.5\"E) or Site B (29°05'06.8\"N 117°55'44.4\"E) of the main experiment.

Main Experiment plots have a size of 1 mu, which is about 25x25m^2 in horizontal projection. Pilot Study Plots have a size of 1x1 m^2.  \nResearch plots on the main experiment have a \"p\" in front of their IDs and then a 6 digit code: Plots in the main sites A (29°07'28.2\"N 117°54'27.5\"E) and B (29°05'06.8\"N 117°55'44.4\"E) are named according to their position in the original spreadsheet, in which they were designed.  They consist of 6 digits: _1st digit_: Site (1:A, 2:B), _digit 2and3_: southwards row: as in spreadsheets the rows are named from the top to the bottom; _digit 4 and 5_: westward column: as in the original spreadsheet, but the letters are converted to numbers (A=01, B=02); _6th digit_: indicator, if the plot has been shifted a quarter mu.  Example: \"p205260\": \"p\" means that this is a plot that is specified.  \"2\" means, that we are at site B.  Now the coordinates of the south - west corner: \"0526\".  Since \"e\" is the fifth letter of the alphabet, this is Plot E26.   The last digit \"0\" means that this plot was not moved by a quarter of a Mu, as some sites in Site A. The 6th digit can also indicate the subplot within the plot. \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\" indicate the northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest quarter plot respectively.\nMorover, Plots from the main experiment may be labelled in the more ambiguous  form of e.g. A32. This indicates a plat either on Site A (29°07'28.2\"N 117°54'27.5\"E) or Site B (29°05'06.8\"N 117°55'44.4\"E) of the main experiment. This value only becomes a unique identifier if supported with the \"site\" information from another cell.\nPlots labelled in the form of \"1_AO1\" or \"g1_AO1\" or \"pilot1_AO1\" belong to the \"Pilot Experiment\" (approx location:  29°06'20.2\"N 117°55'12.1\"E, Jiangxi Province) (PTAG: plot code, BEF research plot name, 6 digits with \"p\" in front; Datagroup description: Research plots of the Biodiversity - Ecosystem functioning experiment (BEF-China).

Main Experiment plots have a size of 1 mu, which is about 25x25m^2 in horizontal projection. Pilot Study Plots have a size of 1x1 m^2.  \nResearch plots on the main experiment have a \"p\" in front of their IDs and then a 6 digit code: Plots in the main sites A (29°07'28.2\"N 117°54'27.5\"E) and B (29°05'06.8\"N 117°55'44.4\"E) are named according to their position in the original spreadsheet, in which they were designed.  They consist of 6 digits: _1st digit_: Site (1:A, 2:B), _digit 2and3_: southwards row: as in spreadsheets the rows are named from the top to the bottom; _digit 4 and 5_: westward column: as in the original spreadsheet, but the letters are converted to numbers (A=01, B=02); _6th digit_: indicator, if the plot has been shifted a quarter mu.  Example: \"p205260\": \"p\" means that this is a plot that is specified.  \"2\" means, that we are at site B.  Now the coordinates of the south - west corner: \"0526\".  Since \"e\" is the fifth letter of the alphabet, this is Plot E26.   The last digit \"0\" means that this plot was not moved by a quarter of a Mu, as some sites in Site A. The 6th digit can also indicate the subplot within the plot. \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\" indicate the northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest quarter plot respectively.\nMorover, Plots from the main experiment may be labelled in the more ambiguous  form of e.g. A32. This indicates a plat either on Site A (29°07'28.2\"N 117°54'27.5\"E) or Site B (29°05'06.8\"N 117°55'44.4\"E) of the main experiment.

Sampling was then reduced to five depth increments (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50 cm). Samples were air-dried, sieved &lt; 2mm, grinded using a ball mill.\n\nCation exchange capacity (CEC) and concentrations of Na, K, Mg, Ca, Mn, Fe, Al and H were measured with an ICP-OES (Perkin Elmer DV 5300 ICP OES).

The general aim of the common garden experiment is to test for additional density dependent intraspecific competition for light in the absence of host-specific agents necessary for J-C effects. Density dependent patterns that are prevalent in the main experiment, while not being prevalent in the common garden experiment can be considered true J-C effects (see \"Common Garden Experiment: Seedling addition experiment - growth and biomass data\" for further details)\n\n\n\n\n\n2015-04-30 00:00:00 UTC - 2016-09-30 00:00:00 UTC\n\nPlots of the main experiment on Site A and B\n\n\n\n\nWe implemented a reciprocal transplant experiment with juvenile plants using monocultures of 11 different tree species and following a home-away design, i.e. planting transplants in their own monoculture (home) and in a different one (away). The species represent a subset of the Main Experiment�€™s species pool and had been selected according to their representation at the two sites and finally included 6 evergreen and 5 deciduous species. From the species pool, 10 species were implemented at site A and 7 species at site B, thus 6 species were used on both sites. For each species, 3 monoculture plots were selected at each site and used for subplot implementation according to the project-specific experimental setup. The general design of BEF-China provides two �€˜true�€™ replicates of each species�€™ monocultures at the plot level (i.e. where all 20 * 20 planted individuals belong to the same species). As a third replicate, we used 2-species mixtures including the respective target species and therein, all subplots were established in between four individuals of the target species.\n\nAll site-specific target species were planted in suplots either established in their own monoculture (home: 3 replicates each) or in monocultures of the other species within site (away: 9 species * 3 replicates, i.e. 27 plots site A and 18 for site B, respectively). Three monocultures in total, (1 in site A and 2 in site B) could not be realised. This approach was used to test for distance dependence. \n\nIn order to test for effects of density-dependence, each subplot, was then subdivided in split-plots where tree seedlings were planted in conspecific communities at different density levels of 4, 9 and 25 individuals each. Accordingly, in target plots at site A, each five subplots (hosting each two species) were implemented, whereas at site B, the number of subplots per plot was lower because of the lower number of species tested. Thus, in each 29 and 19 plots (for site A and B, respectively), 5 and 4 subplots (for site A and B, respectively) were randomly allocated with each subplot 1.5 m x 1.0 m in size. Each splitplots occupied an area of 0.5 x 0.5 m in size. Species �— density combinations were randomly allocated within subplot.\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://china.befdata.biow.uni-leipzig.de/datasets/577\nMain Experiment: Seedling addition experiment - growth and biomass data\n\n/datasets/577\n\nASCII\n\n\n1\ncolumn\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://china.befdata.biow.uni-leipzig.de/datasets/577/download.csv?separate_category_columns=true\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper (Samplenr), \nSamplenr\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set (Samplenr: An individual number for each taken sample)\n\n\n\n\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\nAn individual number for each taken sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper (Seedlingnr), \nSeedlingnr\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set (Seedlingnr: An individual number for each seedling)\n\n\n\n\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\nAn individual number for each seedling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper (Plot), \nPlot\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set (Plot: Plot)\n\n\n\n\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\nPlot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper (Subplot), \nSubplot\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set (Subplot: An individual number for each subplot)\n\n\n\n\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\nAn individual number for each subplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper (Splitplot), \nSplitplot\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set (Splitplot: An individual number for each splitplot)\n\n\n\n\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\nAn individual number for each splitplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper (Indnr_Splitplot), \nIndnr_Splitplot\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set (Indnr_Splitplot: An individual number for each seedling within each splitplot)\n\n\n\n\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\nAn individual number for each seedling within each splitplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper (Record), \nRecord\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set (Record: number for the records)\n\n\n\n\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\nnumber for the records\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimental Site (Site), \nSite\nExperimental site of the Main Experiment.

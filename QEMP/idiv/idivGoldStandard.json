Bats are natural candidates for studies on forest fragmentation. How-ever, the conclusions of such studies are often contradictory. We present the results of a study on the effects of forest fragmentation on bat communities in Alter do Cha�œo, San-tare´m area, in Central Amazonia, Brazil, an area composed by forests and fragments sur-rounded by savanna-like vegetation. We compared the species composition between habitats, tested the effect of size, shape and density of trees of forested areas on the pres-ence species and their relative frequency of captures, and investigated the savannas as anecological barrier for the dispersion of bats. With an effort of 5678 mistnet-hours, we cap-tured 3740 bats (64 species). Multidimensional Scaling indicated no strong separation between the habitats sampled, however, savanna sites were grouped distinctly of frag-ments and forest sites. Multiple linear regressions indicated no signi��cant correlationbetween the number of bat species recorded and the size, shape or tree density in forest sites and fragments. There was a signi��cant correlation between the number of captures and the variables tested, explained by the shape of the sites, but not by size or tree density. In general, sites with bigger shape indices had fewer captures. Ten of the 20 most captured species showed no signi��cant difference between the three habitats. The bat communitiesin Alter do Cha�œo were not strongly affected by forest fragmentation, and the savannas did not appear to act as an ecological barrier to bats.\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Enrico Bernard\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Mario Liebergesell\n                    \n                    \n                      mario.liebergesell@idiv.de\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Enrico Bernard\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              bat capturing in 5 continuous forest sites (&gt; 750 ha), 11 forest fragments (6-360 ha, mean: 84,6 ha) &amp; 11 savanna sites; catching nets (12 x 2.5 m) along 150 m transect trails; 6-10 in fragments, 6-12 nets in savannas, 10-14 nets in forest sites\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              restricted - part of a meta-analysis (we do not own the data)\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              Bernard, E. &amp; Fenton, M.B., 2007.

We employed an island biogeographic approach to determine whether small fragments of the shrub habitats coastal sage scrub and chaparral, isolated by urbanization, are capable of supporting viable populations of native rodent species. The distribution of native rodents in 25 urban habitat fragments was assessed by live-trapping. Over half of the fragments surveyed (13 of 25) did not support populations of native rodents. Fragments supported fewer species than equivalently sized plots in large expanses of unfragmented habitat, and older fragments (fragments that had been isolated for a longer period of time) supported fewer species. Both results implied that local extinctions occurred in the fragments following insularization. Stepwise multiple polychotomous logistic regression was used to determine which biogeographic variables were the best predictors of species number across fragments. The area of shrub habitat in each fragment was the most significant predictor of species diversity; age of a fragment was also significant and was negatively correlated with species number, but the isolation distance of a fragment had no relationship to species diversity. We found a negative relationship between extinction vulnerability of native rodent species and relative abundance: species that were more abundant in unfragmented habitat persisted in more habitat fragments. Random environmental and demographic fluctuations (island effects) and edge effects associated with fragmentation  are proposed as causes of these local extinctions.\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Douglas T Bolger\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Mario Liebergesell\n                    \n                    \n                      mario.liebergesell@idiv.de\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Douglas T Bolger\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              rodent trapping in 25 fragments (0.125 ha- 84.1 ha) and in 3 continuous control plots (plot sizes in controls 0.12, 0.5, 1 ha inside continuous habitat; total area of of two sites containing the 3 plots: 1000 - 4500 ha)\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              restricted - part of a meta-analysis (we do not own the data)\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              Bolger, D.T. et al., 1997.

We compared the current bird community structure and composition amongthree habitat types, i.e., old (&gt;50 years, 7�€“935 ha) and young ( 6 50 years, 29�€“49 ha) naturally regenerating secondary forests and abandoned wooded plantations (27�€“102 ha) dominated by exotic species. Forest patch area had the strongest in�‚uence on the current species richness. The overall bird richness was not greater in most mature forest patches, but 20 species were only found inthe old secondary forests and ��ve of these were found in &lt;50% of these patches. The rapid decrease in the number of forest species in plantations was o�€set by an increase in the number of open habitat species. Comparisons with current bird communities in nearby mainland forest sites (Peninsular Malaysia) suggest that the forest avifauna of Singapore is depauperate. The preservation of larger mature and maturing forests is therefore required for conserving the extant forest avifauna in Singapore.Connecting isolated patches can also be envisioned to facilitate movements of forest birds that have low densities and restricted distribution.\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Marjorie  Castelletta\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Mario Liebergesell\n                    \n                    \n                      mario.liebergesell@idiv.de\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Marjorie  Castelletta\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              9-12 bird surveys in (every one of) 17 patches divided in three classes (different sizes): old secondary forest (6; 7-935 ha), young secondary forest (4; 29-49 ha) and abandonded plantations (7; 27-102 ha), collections with nist netting\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              restricted - part of a meta-analysis (we do not own the data)\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              Castelletta, M., Thiollay, J.M. &amp; Sodhi, N.S., 2005.

Qualitative habitat changes induced by fragmentation, such as edge formation and forest regrowth affected bat community structure; both modi��ed habitats comprised a limited subset of the species assemblage found in the interiors of mature forests.The results presented here provide evidence of impoverished bat assemblages in man-modi��ed habitats linked with deforestation and overall disturbances related with forest fragmentation.\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Deborah Faria\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Mario Liebergesell\n                    \n                    \n                      mario.liebergesell@idiv.de\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Deborah Faria\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n               six main habitat types (interior/ edges * large/ small -&gt; &gt;1000 ha, &lt; 100 ha and secondary forest and shade cocoa plantations) * 3 replicate sampling blocks; mist netting along 100m-transects  in all sites\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              restricted - part of a meta-analysis (we do not own the data)\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              Faria, D., 2006.

A total of 28 species and4178 individuals of ground beetles were collected. Segregation of urban forests from continuous suburban forests has changed the species composition and resulted in the loss of some large-sized forest species and theaddition of some non-forest species. Simpson�€™s index of dominance (l) also increased in the urban forests.The richness of forest species markedly decreased with the reduction in forest area but not with the distance from continuous forests, although the species richness of non-forest species did not change with them. Also,species composition changed only with forest area. These ��ndings indicate that continuous forests do notnecessary serve as a �€œmainland�€� for urban forest species and that every urban habitat, however small in size, acts as a temporary reservoir of species. In comparison with populations of small-sized species, populationsof large-sized forest species appeared to decline more readily during forest fragmentation.\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Atsushi Fujita\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Mario Liebergesell\n                    \n                    \n                      mario.liebergesell@idiv.de\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Atsushi Fujita\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n               3 contiuous suburban plots and 8 isolated urban plots/ fragments (0.06- 10.2 ha); pit fall trapping (12 per plot)\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              restricted - part of a meta-analysis (we do not own the data)\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              Fujita, A. et al., 2008.

In  1986-1987  three live-trapping  methods  were  used  to  census  small  mammals  at  52 sites  in fragmented  and unfragmented  rain forest  in  NE  Queensland,  Australia.  Forest  structural, floristic,  edaphic  and  landscape  data from  each  site  were used  to  assess  patterns  of  microhabitat  use  in  common species.  Trapping  censuses  yielded  5,784  captures  of  15 species  of  rodents  or  marsupials.  Species  encountered  in modified  habitats  surrounding  fragments  usually  re- mained  stable  or  increased  in  fragments  (Melomys cervinipes, Rattus leucopus,  R.  fuscipes,  Uromys caudi- maculatus,  Antechinus  flavipes,  Hydromys  chryso- gaster),  whereas  those  that  avoided  these  habitats declined  or  disappeared  (A.  stuartii,  A.  godmani,  Hyp- siprimnodon  moschatus).  Fragments  were  more  heavily disturbed  within  200-500  m  of forest  edges,  and  mam- mals  that  favored  disturbed forest  or  edges  (Melomys, R.  leucopus,  A.  flavipes)  increased  in  many fragments. Assemblages  of  abundant  native  rodents  appeared  more intensively  structured  in fragments  than  in  unfragmented .forest,  with  strong  competitive  interactions  occurring  be- tween  ecologically  similar  species  in fragments.\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      William F Laurance\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Mario Liebergesell\n                    \n                    \n                      mario.liebergesell@idiv.de\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      William F Laurance\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              15 sites of fragmented (10, 1.4- 590 ha) and continuous forests (5, &gt; 3000 ha), trapping in a total of 52 grids (30 m x 30 m), number of grids size dependent\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              restricted - part of a meta-analysis (we do not own the data)\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              Laurance, W.F., 1994.

In  this  study, we  statistically  tested  whether  the  area-diversity  relationship  predicted  by  the  island biogeography  theory  can  successfully  be  used  to  explain  differences  in  tree  species  diversity among  different  woodland  patch  sizes  in  Nyabamba  resettlement  area  of  south-eastern Zimbabwe.  We  used  IKONOS  imagery  of  2009  to  classify  woodland,  plantation  and  cropland areas, and GIS to calculate the woodland patch sizes. Tree species diversity was calculated from field  data  and  then  quantified  using  Simpson�€™s  (1-D)  index.  One  Way  ANOVA  and  Post  Hoc analysis were used to test whether woodland patches of different sizes (less than 4 ha, between 4-25 ha and greater than 25 ha) had significant differences in mean tree species diversity. Our results show that larger patches had significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher mean species diversity than smaller woodland patches. The results indicate that the island biogeography theory can be used to explain tree species diversity differences in an agriculturally fragmented woodland.\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Charity Nyelele\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Mario Liebergesell\n                    \n                    \n                      mario.liebergesell@idiv.de\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Charity Nyelele\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              30 stratified random sampling point (from a previous generated map), at each point: 15 m x 15 m plot, three size classes calculated (&lt; 4 ha, 4-25 ha, &gt; 25 ha); observing of all trees within the plots\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              restricted - part of a meta-analysis (we do not own the data)\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              Nyelele, C. et al., 2014.

An experimental study of short-term community responses\n            \n            \n              English\n            \n            \n              Abstract.  We  studied  the  effect  of  habitat  fragmentation  on  the  richness,  diversity, turnover, and abundance  of  breeding  bird communities  in  old,  boreal  mixed-wood  forest by  creating  isolated  and connected  forest  fragments  of  1,  10,  40,  and  100  ha.  Connected fragments were linked by 100 m wide riparian buffer strips. Each size class within treatments and controls  was replicated  three times.  We sampled  the passerine  community  using  point counts before, and in each of two years after, forest harvesting,  accumulating 21 340 records representing  59  species.  We detected  no  significant  change  in  species richness  as  a result of  the  harvesting,  except  in  the  1-ha  connected  fragments,  where  the  number of  species increased  two  years  after isolation.  This  increase  was  accounted  for by  transient species, suggesting  that the adjacent buffer strips were being used as movement  corridors. Diversity (log  series  alpha index)  was dependent on area in the isolated  fragments only  after cutting, having  decreased  in  the  smaller  areas. Turnover rates in  the  isolated  fragments  were  sig- nificantly  higher  than in  similar  connected  or control  areas,  due  to  species  replacement. Crowding occurred in the isolated  fragments immediately  after cutting,  but two  years after fragmentation, the responses  in abundance of species  varied with migratory strategy. Num- bers of Neotropical  migrants declined in both connected  and isolated fragments, and resident species  declined  in  isolated  fragments.  Most  species  in  these  groups  require older  forest, many  favoring  interior  areas.  Abundance  of  short-distance  migrants,  most  of  which  are habitat  generalists,  did  not  change.  Overall,  although  there  was  no  decrease  in  species richness  from our recently  fragmented areas, community  structure was altered; maintaining connections  between fragments helped to mitigate these effects.  Nevertheless,  the magnitude of  the fragmentation  effects  we  documented  is  small  compared  with  those  observed  else- where.  Birds  breeding  in  the  boreal  forest,  where  frequent  small-  and large-scale  natural disturbances  have  occurred  historically,  may  be  more  resilient  to  human-induced  habitat changes,  such  as  those  caused  by  forest  harvesting.  However,  these  results  should  be  in- terpreted with  caution.  First, they  are short-term and address only  broad-scale  community responses  based  on  species richness  and relative  abundance.  Second,  the  study  area was embedded in a landscape where large areas of old, mixed forest are still available, potentially dampening  any  local-scale  impacts  of  fragmentation.\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Fiona K A Schmiegelow\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Mario Liebergesell\n                    \n                    \n                      mario.liebergesell@idiv.de\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Fiona K A Schmiegelow\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              4 fragments of varying sizes (1, 10, 40, 100 ha) and two treatments (connected, isolated -&gt; no 400 ha) with common controls (4000 ha); point count method (50-100 m in r) in  permanent sampling stations at 200-m intervals along transects 200-m apart; sampling density in proportion to area size\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              restricted - part of a meta-analysis (we do not own the data)\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              Schmiegelow, F.K.A., Machtans, C.S. &amp; Hannon, S.J., 1997.

In experiment A, two subplots of 1 x 1 m were established in autumn 2009. In one subplot, regular weeding was continued during the entire study, whereas in the other subplot, weeding was stopped for approximately two years allowing for plant colonization. Those subplots were given up after this sampling campaign. In the experiment B, new subplots (5 x 3 m) were established in 2009, following the same principle as in experiment A: in one subplot, regular weeding was continued, and in the other subplot, weeding was stopped. In both experiments, soil samples were pooled, homogenized, sieved (2 mm), and approximately 5 g (fresh weight) of each soil sample was used for the measurement of soil microbial biomass and respiration. Microbial respiration (µL O2 h-1 g-1 soil dry mass) was measured as mean of the O2 consumption rates of 14 to 24 hours after the start of the measurements using an O2-microcompensation apparatus. Soil microbial biomass C (µg C g-1 soil dry mass) was measured by substrate-induced respiration (SIR) after the addition of D-Glucose. Gravimetric soil water content (%) was determined as the difference in percentages of fresh vs. dry soil (dried at 70 °C for 24 h). \n            \n            \n               Using a metal corer, five soil samples (diameter 2 cm, 10 cm deep) per subplot were randomly taken in June 2011. Additionally, plant cover (%) of resident and colonizing plant species were estimated after Londo (1976) and used as a proxy for plant productivity.  Like described above, five soil samples per subplot were randomly taken in May 2014, i.e., after five years of plant colonization. Here, plant productivity was measured as aboveground plant biomass (g m-2). \n            \n            \n              O2-microcompensation apparatus\n            \n            \n              \n

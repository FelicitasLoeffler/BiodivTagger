{"text":"Data from: Adaptive responses and local stressor mitigation drive coral resilience in warmer, more acidic oceans Jury, Christopher P. Toonen, Robert J. climate change ocean acidification adaptation acclimatisation super corals resilience Coral reefs have great biological and socioeconomic value, but are threatened by ocean acidification, climate change, and local human impacts. The capacity for corals to adapt or acclimatise to novel environmental conditions is unknown but fundamental to projected reef futures. The coral reefs of Kāne‘ohe Bay, Hawai‘i were devastated by anthropogenic insults from the 1930s-1970s. These reefs experience naturally reduced pH and elevated temperature relative to many other Hawaiian reefs which are not expected to face similar conditions for decades. Despite catastrophic loss in coral cover due to human disturbance, these reefs recovered under low pH and high temperature within 20 years after sewage input was diverted. We compare the pH and temperature tolerances of three dominant Hawaiian coral species from within Kāne‘ohe Bay to conspecifics from a nearby control site and show that corals from Kāne‘ohe are far more resistant to acidification and warming. These results show that corals can have different pH and temperature tolerances among habitats and understanding the mechanisms by which coral cover rebounded within two decades under projected future ocean conditions will be critical to management. Together these results indicate that reducing human stressors offers hope for reef resilience and effective conservation over coming decades. 2019-04-23T16:22:33Z 2019-04-23T16:22:33Z 2019-05-15 Article doi:10.5061/dryad.c06p34h Jury CP, Toonen RJ (2019) Adaptive responses and local stressor mitigation drive coral resilience in warmer, more acidic oceans.

Reminiscent of classic ecogeographical rules, environmental factors vary in predictable ways with ocean depth, leading to predictions about organismal phenotypes. A valuable group for studying associations between habitat depth and phenotype is cylindroleberidid ostracods (Crustacea) because of previous phylogenetic analyses and their enormous depth range. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we asked how habitat depth relates to body size and eye morphology in 232 cylindroleberidid species measured from museum specimens and literature descriptions. For each species, we recorded maximum habitat depth, body size, absolute eye size, number of ommatidia (facets) per eye, and diameter of the largest ommatidium. We find that the relationship between morphology and habitat depth in cylindroleberidids depends on pelagic zone: as depth increases in the photic zone, body size increases and eyes have fewer ommatidia; as depth increases in the disphotic zone, body size does not change and eyes have more ommatidia. We did not find a relationship between absolute eye size and depth in either pelagic zone. Overall, we find that associations between phenotypes and ecogeographical gradients depend on interactions between contexts such as pelagic zone, character state, and evolutionary history.\n\t2019-04-23T17:01:01Z\n\t2019-04-23T17:01:01Z\n\t2019-04-23\n\tArticle\n\tdoi:10.5061/dryad.qh46k18.1\n\thttp://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.214431\n\tdoi:10.5061/dryad.qh46k18.1/1.1\n","entities":{"Environment":[{"indices":[102,107]},{"indices":[215,223]},{"indices":[220,223]},{"indices":[526,531]},{"indices":[840,847]},{"indices":[1025,1032]},{"indices":[1201,1208]}],"Material":[],"Process":[],"Quality":[{"indices":[108,113]},{"indices":[215,219]},{"indices":[532,537]},{"indices":[650,655]},{"indices":[774,779]},{"indices":[848,853]},{"indices":[870,874]},{"indices":[1033,1038]},{"indices":[1045,1049]},{"indices":[1064,1068]},{"indices":[1112,1120]},{"indices":[1209,1214]},{"indices":[1265,1270]},{"indices":[1306,1310]},{"indices":[1355,1360]},{"indices":[1399,1403]},{"indices":[1502,1506]},{"indices":[1511,1516]}]}}

Fontainea picrosperma is a subcanopy rainforest tree that is of commercial interest because it is the source of tigilanol tiglate, a natural product used for the treatment of solid tumors.  We identify patterns of pollen-mediated gene flow within natural populations of F. picrosperma and estimate genetic parameters and genetic structure between adult and juvenile groups using microsatellite markers.  Our results show pollination events occur over much shorter distances than reported for tropical canopy species.  At least 63 % of seeds are sired by male trees located within 30 m of the mother.  On average, 27 % of the local male population contributed to successful reproduction of F. picrosperma with most fathers siring a single seed, however, the contributions to reproduction were uneven.  Larger male trees with more flowers had greaterreproductive success than those with less flowers (P &lt; 0.05).  There were comparatively low levels of genetic variation across the species (HE = 0.405 for adult trees and 0.379 for juveniles) and we found no loss of genetic diversity between adult and juvenile trees.  Short distance pollen flow and low genetic diversity is theoretically a prelude to genetic impoverishment, however F. picrosperma has persisted through multiple significant climatic oscillations.  Nevertheless, the remaining low genetic diversity is of concern for domestication programs which require maximal genetic diversity to facilitate efficient selective breeding and genetic improvement of this commercially significant species.\n\t2019-04-30T20:53:42Z\n\t2019-04-30T20:53:42Z\n\t2019-04-30\n\tArticle\n\tdoi:10.5061/dryad.73pn293\n\thttp://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.215197\n\tdoi:10.5061/dryad.73pn293/1\n\tdoi:10.5061/dryad.73pn293/2\n\tdoi:10.5061/dryad.73pn293/3\n\tAtherton Tablelands\n\tQueensland\n\tAustralia\n","entities":{"Environment":[{"indices":[95,105]},{"indices":[472,482]}],"Material":[],"Process":[{"indices":[597,606]},{"indices":[856,867]},{"indices":[1108,1120]},{"indices":[1209,1221]}],"Quality":[{"indices":[13,18]},{"indices":[13,27]},{"indices":[19,27]},{"indices":[86,94]},{"indices":[899,908]},{"indices":[927,935]},{"indices":[1555,1560]},{"indices":[1555,1569]},{"indices":[1561,1569]}]}}

Explanations for this diversity are usually classed as either “equilibrium”, with elevated MTE diversity resulting from greater ecological carrying capacities, or “non-equilibrium”, with MTEs having a greater accumulation of diversity over time. These models have typically been considered as mutually exclusive. Here we present a trait-based explanatory framework that incorporates both equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics. Using a large continental Australian plant radiation (Hakea) as a case study, we identify traits associated with niche partitioning in co-occurring species (α traits) and with environmental filtering (β traits), and reconstruct the mode and relative timing of diversification of these traits. Our results point to a radiation with an early, non-equilibrium phase marked by divergence of β traits as Hakea diversified exponentially and expanded from the southwest Australian MTE into biomes across the Australian continent. This was followed from 7Mya by an equilibrium phase, marked by diversification of α traits and a slowdown in lineage diversification as the MTE niches became saturated. These results suggest that processes consistent with both equilibrium and non-equilibrium models have been important during different stages of the radiation of Hakea, and together they provide a richer explanation of present-day diversity patterns.\n\t2019-05-15T15:30:05Z\n\t2019-05-15T15:30:05Z\n\t2019-05-15\n\tArticle\n\tdoi:10.5061/dryad.dc036n6\n\tSkeels A, Cardillo M (2019) Equilibrium and non‐equilibrium phases in the radiation of hakea and the drivers of diversity in Mediterranean‐type ecosystems.

We refine predictive frameworks from two North American systems, the inland temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest (PNW) and the Southwestern Aridlands (SWAL), by incorporating a number of organismal trait variables. Our results indicate that incorporating life history traits as predictor variables improves the performance of the supervised machine-learning approach to predictive phylogeography, especially for the SWAL system, in which predictions made from only taxonomic and climate variables meets only moderate success. In particular, traits related to reproduction (e.g., reproductive mode; clutch size) and trophic level appear to be particularly informative to the predictive framework.

A prominent example of this can be found in drylands, where formation of vegetation patterns attenuates the magnitude of degradation events in response to decreasing rainfall. In model studies, the pattern wavelength responds to changing conditions, which is reflected by a rather gradual decline in biomass in response to decreasing rainfall. Although these models are spatially explicit, they have adopted a mean-field approach to grazing. By taking into account spatial variability when modelling grazing, we find that (over)grazing can lead to a dramatic shift in biomass, so that degradation occurs at rainfall rates that would otherwise still maintain a relatively productive ecosystem. Moreover, grazing increases the resilience of degraded ecosystem states. Consequently, restoration of degraded ecosystems could benefit from the introduction of temporary small-scale exclosures, to escape from the basin of attraction of degraded states.\n\t2019-03-13T21:46:56Z\n\t2019-03-13T21:46:56Z\n\t2019-03-01\n\tArticle\n\tdoi:10.5061/dryad.pb62bk0.3\n\tSiero E, Siteur K, Doelman A, van de Koppel J, Rietkerk M, Eppinga MB (2019) Grazing Away the Resilience of Patterned Ecosystems.

In many parts of the world, apex predators live in, or are returning to, landscapes that have been modified by people, so it is important to understand their ecological role in anthropogenic landscapes. We used motion-activated game cameras to compare the activity patterns of humans and two mesopredators, coyotes (Canis latrans) and bobcats (Lynx rufus), in areas with and without an apex predator, the gray wolf (Canis lupus), in a multi-use landscape of the northwestern United States. In areas with wolves there was a significant increase in temporal niche overlap between the mesopredators owing to higher levels of coyote activity at all time periods of the day. Temporal overlap between mesopredators and humans also increased significantly in the presence of wolves. Coyotes exposed to wolves increased their activity during dawn, day, and dusk hours. The increase in coyote activity was greatest during the day, when wolves were least active. The direction of change in bobcat activity in areas with wolves was opposite to coyotes, suggesting a behaviorally-mediated cascade between wolves, coyotes, and bobcats, although these findings would need to be confirmed with further research. Our findings suggest that mesopredators in human-dominated systems may perceive humans as less dangerous than apex predators, that humans may be more likely to encounter mesopredators in areas occupied by top predators, and that behaviorally-mediated effects of apex predators on mesopredators persist in human-dominated landscapes.\n\t2019-05-07T15:05:11Z\n\t2019-05-07T15:05:11Z\n\t2019-06-19\n\tArticle\n\tdoi:10.5061/dryad.60m1ps0\n\tShores CR, Dellinger JA, Newkirk ES, Kachel SM, Wirsing AJ (2019) Mesopredators change temporal activity in response to a recolonizing apex predator.
